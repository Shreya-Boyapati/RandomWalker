=======================
#### The goal of this algorithm is to perform random walks on a graph computed by graphGenerator module and find valuable nodes

Overview
---
* Random Walker can be found at [https://github.com/Shreya-Boyapati/hw2/tree/main]
* Main.scala contains functionality for random walker algorithm
  * Recreates orig graph and perturbed graph created by [NetGameSim](https://github.com/0x1DOCD00D/NetGameSim) and performs simrank algorithm
  * Creates GraphX graph from input file and performs parallel random walks
  * Random walk executed until an attackable node is found based on simrank and valuableData property (valuableDataProbability = 0.25d)

 Running Main should give log entries that look something like this:
 ```14:21:51.578 [main] INFO org.apache.spark.SparkContext -- Successfully stopped SparkContext
14:21:51.578 [main] INFO main -- Result:
14:21:51.578 [main] INFO main -- Attacked!
14:21:51.578 [main] INFO main -- Attacked!
14:21:51.578 [main] INFO main -- Attacked!
14:21:51.578 [main] INFO main -- Attacked!
14:21:51.578 [main] INFO main -- Attacked!
```
* Scalatest dependency is used for testing
* Typesafe configuration dependency is used to manage configuration options in application.conf
* Logback classic dependency is used for logging

File Generation
---
* Files for this project are generated by [graphGenerator](https://github.com/Shreya-Boyapati/graphGenerator)
* graphGenerator is a modification of NetGameSim which outputs files in .txt format
* First output file is a collection of nodes, edges, and valuableData values to be reconstructed into MutableValueGraph graphs
* Second output file is a list of edges used to create GraphX graph

Configuration
---
* application.conf contains parameters necessary for random walk execution
  * numWalks - number of random walks that will be performed
  * shardsFile - first file created by graphGenerator
  * graphFile - second file created by graphGenerator
 
  The files currently used are given here as [input.txt](https://github.com/Shreya-Boyapati/hw2/blob/main/src/main/resources/input.txt) and [input2.txt](https://github.com/Shreya-Boyapati/hw2/blob/main/src/main/resources/input2.txt) in src/main/resources/

Installing, Compiling and Running random walker 
---
* To build from the command line [SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Setup.html), [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/download/) and a [JDK/JVM](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/) should be installed and configured
* Once all prerequisites are met, clone [hw2](https://github.com/Shreya-Boyapati/hw2/tree/main) using the command ```git clone```;
* Once the repository is cloned, assuming its local path is the root directory ```/path/to/the/cloned/hw2``` open a terminal window and switch to the directory ```cd /path/to/the/cloned/hw2```;
* Build and run the project using the command ```sbt clean compile run```
* Alternatively, you can load the project into IntelliJ and compile and run it using the main entry point in [Main.scala](src/main/scala/Main.scala). Make sure it is loaded as an sbt project.
* You should make sure that the Java version that is used to compile this project matches the JVM version that is used to run the generated program jar from the command line, otherwise you may receive an error.

Testing
---
Testing on mySimRank was done using [Scalatest](https://github.com/scalatest/) dependency. Tests can be found in src/tests/scala
  1. addNodes
  2. attackNode
  3. equalGraphs
  4. removeNodes
  5. shouldAttack
