Overview
---
* Random Walker can be found at [https://github.com/Shreya-Boyapati/hw2/tree/main]
* Main.scala contains functionality for random walker algorithm
  * Recreates orig graph and perturbed graph created by [NetGameSim](https://github.com/0x1DOCD00D/NetGameSim) and performs simrank algorithm
  * Creates GraphX graph from input file and performs parallel random walks
  * Random walk executed until an attackable node is found based on simrank and valuableData property

 Running Main should give log entries that look something like this:
 ```14:21:51.578 [main] INFO org.apache.spark.SparkContext -- Successfully stopped SparkContext
14:21:51.578 [main] INFO main -- Result:
14:21:51.578 [main] INFO main -- Attacked!
14:21:51.578 [main] INFO main -- Attacked!
14:21:51.578 [main] INFO main -- Attacked!
14:21:51.578 [main] INFO main -- Attacked!
14:21:51.578 [main] INFO main -- Attacked!
```

* Files for this project are generated by [graphGenerator](https://github.com/Shreya-Boyapati/graphGenerator)
* graphGenerator is a modification of NetGameSim which outputs files in .txt format
* First output file is a collection of nodes, edges, and valuableData values to be reconstructed into MutableValueGraph graphs
* Second output file is a list of edges used to create GraphX graph

* application.conf contains parameters necessary for random walk execution
  * numWalks - number of random walks that will be performed
  * shardsFile - first file created by graphGenerator
  * graphFile - second file created by graphGenerator
 
### The filepaths in application.conf MUST BE UPDATED or the program will not function
The files used are given here as x and y
